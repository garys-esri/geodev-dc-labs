# Exercise 3: Add a Local Feature Layer (Mac OS S/Swift)

This exercise walks you through the following:
- Add a layer from a mobile map package to the 2D map
- Add a layer from a mobile map package to the 3D scene

Prerequisites:
- Complete [Exercise 2](Exercise 2 Zoom Buttons.md), or get the Exercise 2 code solution compiling and running properly in Xcode.

If you need some help, you can refer to [the solution to this exercise](../../../solutions/OS X/Swift/Ex3_LocalFeatureLayer), available in this repository.

## Add a layer from a mobile map package to the 2D map

ArcGIS Runtime provides a variety of ways to add **operational layers** to the map and scene--feature services, dynamic map services, offline geodatabases, and mobile map packages, for example. In this exercise, you will use the newest of these: a mobile map package.

1. Download the [D.C. Crime Data mobile map package (`DC_Crime_Data.mmpk`)](../../../data/DC_Crime_Data.mmpk) that we have prepared for you. In Xcode, add `DC_Crime`Data.mmpk` to your project (select your project in the Navigator and choose **File** > **Add Files to <project name>**).

1. In `ViewController.swift`, declare a constant for the MMPK path. Use `NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource` to construct the path:

    ```
    private let MMPK_PATH = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("DC_Crime_Data", ofType:"mmpk")
    ```

1. At the end of `viewDidLoad()`, instantiate an `AGSMobileMapPackage` with the mobile map package constant. Then load the mobile map package with a completion to run when the mobile map package is done loading:

    ```
    let mmpk = AGSMobileMapPackage(path: MMPK_PATH!)
    mmpk.loadWithCompletion { [weak self] (error: NSError?) in
        
    }
    ```
    
1. Inside the `loadWithCompletion` completion code, get the `MobileMapPackage`'s maps. A mobile map package can contain multiple maps. `DC_Crime_Data.mmpk` only has one map, but it's a good idea to make sure there's at least one. If so, get the first map (index 0), and use it to set the map viewâ€™s map. (That's the easy way to add the mobile map package's layers; we will need to use a different way later in this exercise to add the layers to a 3D scene.) The map in this mobile map package has no basemap, so it's a good idea to set the basemap again. Here's the code that goes inside the event handler method:

    ```
    if 0 < mmpk.maps.count {
        self!.mapView.map = mmpk.maps[0]
    }
    self!.mapView.map!.basemap = AGSBasemap.nationalGeographicBasemap()
    ```
    
1. Run your app. Verify that the map zooms to Washington, D.C., and that a layer of crime incidents appears on top of the basemap. The incidents appear as red triangles, which is the symbology specified in the mobile map package:

## Add a layer from a mobile map package to the 3D scene

A layer can only reside in one map or scene at a time. Therefore, to add layers to the 3D scene, you will have to open the mobile map package again. That will give you an `AGSMap` as before, which you can't use with an `AGSSceneView`--and there is no "`AGSMobileScenePackage`"--so you will have to get the layers from this `AGSMap` and add them to your existing `AGSScene`.

1. At the end of `viewDidLoad()`, instantiate an `AGSMobileMapPackage` with the mobile map package constant. Then load the mobile map package with a completion to run when the mobile map package is done loading. (This should seem familiar.)

    ```
    let sceneMmpk = AGSMobileMapPackage(path: MMPK_PATH!)
    sceneMmpk.loadWithCompletion { [weak self] (error: NSError?) in

    }
    ```
    
1. Inside the `loadWithCompletion` completion code, get the first map in the MMPK, as you did before for the 2D map. However, you cannot add a map to a scene view, so you will instead add the map's layers to the scene's operational layers. But a layer can only belong to one map or scene at a time, so you must make a list of the layers, clear the map's layer list (bonus: see what happens if you don't!), and only then add the list of layers to the scene. Here is the code for adding the MMPK's layers to your scene:

    ```
    if 0 < sceneMmpk.maps.count {
        let thisMap = sceneMmpk.maps[0]
        var layers = [AGSLayer]()
        for layer in thisMap.operationalLayers {
            layers.append(layer as! AGSLayer)
        }
        thisMap.operationalLayers.removeAllObjects()
        self!.sceneView.scene?.operationalLayers.addObjectsFromArray(layers)
    }
    ```
    
1. After adding the layers to the scene (inside the `if` block from the previous step), zoom the scene to Washington, D.C.:

    ```
    self!.sceneView.setViewpoint(AGSViewpoint(latitude: 38.909, longitude: -77.016, scale: 150000))
    ```
    
1. Run your app. Verify that when you switch to 3D, the scene displays Washington, D.C., with the red triangles representing crime incidents:

    ![Mobile map package layer on a 3D scene](06-mmpk-layer-scene.jpg)
    
1. Remember in [Exercise 2](Exercise 2 Zoom Buttons.md#zoom-in-and-out-on-the-map-and-the-scene) when you manipulated a camera to zoom in and out? Here we will also use a camera, but this time we will rotate the camera to provide an oblique view of the scene. We will focus the rotation on the current viewpoint's target point. The `AGSCamera.rotateAroundTargetPoint` method lets us specify a change in heading, pitch, and roll; let's change the heading by 45 degrees and the pitch by 65 degrees. After `rotateAroundTargetPoint`, we will give the rotated camera to the scene view. Here is the code to insert immediately after the previous step (still inside the `if` block):

    ```
    let viewpoint = self!.sceneView.currentViewpointWithType(AGSViewpointType.CenterAndScale)
    let targetPoint = viewpoint?.targetGeometry as! AGSPoint
    let camera = self!.sceneView.currentViewpointCamera()
            .rotateAroundTargetPoint(targetPoint, deltaHeading: 45, deltaPitch: 65, deltaRoll: 0)
    self!.sceneView.setViewpointCamera(camera)
    ```

1. Run your app. Verify that when you switch to 3D, the crime incidents display and the view is rotated and pitched. Also try the built-in 3D navigation by holding the alt key and mouse button and moving the mouse:

## How did it go?

If you have trouble, **refer to the solution code**, which is linked near the beginning of this exercise. You can also **submit an issue** in this repo to ask a question or report a problem. If you are participating live with Esri presenters, feel free to **ask a question** of the presenters.

If you completed the exercise, congratulations! You learned how to add a local feature layer from a mobile map package to a 2D map and a 3D scene.

Ready for more? Choose from the following:

- [**Exercise 4: Buffer a Point and Query Features**](Exercise 4 Buffer and Query.md)
- **Bonus**: we used a mobile map package, but you can also add **feature services** to your map and scene. Go to [ArcGIS Online](http://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html), find a feature service URL (hint: a feature service URL has the term `FeatureServer` at or near the end of the URL), and use the [`AGSFeatureLayer`](https://developers.arcgis.com/os-x/quartz/api-reference//interface_a_g_s_feature_layer.html) and [`AGSServiceFeatureTable`](https://developers.arcgis.com/os-x/quartz/api-reference//interface_a_g_s_service_feature_table.html) classes to add the feature service to your map and/or globe. You can refer to a [code sample](https://developers.arcgis.com/os-x/quartz/swift/sample-code/feature-layer-feature-service.htm) if you need it.
