# Exercise 1: Map and Scene (Mac OS X/Swift)

This exercise walks you through the following:
- Create a new OS X app
- Add ArcGIS Runtime to the app
- Add a 2D map to the app
- Add a 3D scene to the app, and use a toggle button to switch between 2D and 3D

Prerequisites:
- Use a Mac with OS X 10.10 or 10.11.
- Install OS X SDK 10.10 or higher.
- Install Xcode 7.

If you need some help, you can refer to [the solution to this exercise](../../../solutions/OS X/Swift/Ex1_MapAndScene), available in this repository.

## Create a new OS X app

1. Create a new Xcode project for an OS X Cocoa application. For **Language**, choose **Swift**. Make sure that **Use Storyboards** is checked.

1. At any point during the exercises, you can run the app from Xcode. If you run the app now, you should see a blank app window.

1. Open `Main.storyboard` and change the main view’s width and height as desired. To fit all of the buttons you will add in these exercises, use a height of at least 400 pixels. The solutions to these exercises use a size of 800x450.

1. Download the contents of [the images directory](../../../images) of this repository. (This might be easiest if you clone this repo, or if you fork this repo and clone your fork.) Add the images to your Xcode project. This is done in Xcode by opening `Assets.xcassets` and dragging the images from the Finder into `Assets.xcassets`.

1. Open `Main.storyboard`. Use the **Object** library in the **Library** panel to add an **Image Button** to the lower right corner of your storyboard’s main view. Here are some tips in case you are new to Xcode and storyboards:
    - In the **Size** inspector, change the button’s width and height to 50x50.
    - In the **Attributes** inspector, under **Visual**, check the **Bordered** box, and for **Image**, choose `three_d`.
    - Use the **Pin** dialog to add constraints that pin the button 20 pixels from the right edge of the view and 20 pixels above the bottom edge of the view.
    - Click the red arrow next to **View Controller Scene** and add the missing constraints.

1. Run your app. Verify that a button appears in the lower-right corner of the app, even when you resize the window:

    ![Blank app with button](01-blank-app-with-button.png)
    
## Add ArcGIS Runtime to the app

1. In your project directory, create a text file named `Podfile` with the following contents, replacing `WorkshopApp` with the name of your project:

    ```
    platform :osx, '10.11'
    use_frameworks!

    target ‘WorkshopApp' do
        pod 'ArcGIS-Runtime-SDK-OSX', '100.0-beta1'
    end
    ```

1. In a terminal, go to your project directory and run `pod install`. ArcGIS Runtime is downloaded and installed in your project’s new `Pods` directory. (Note: if this `Pods` directory is ever deleted, you can always run `pod install` to get it back. Normally you would not add `Pods` to version control.)

1. Close your Xcode project. In Xcode,  In the Xcode splash window, choose **Open another project…** Navigate to your project directory and choose the `xcworkspace` file, not the `xcodeproj` file. Xcode, in the **Project** navigator, under `MyRuntimeApp` > `Frameworks`, delete `Pods_<app name>.framework`.

## Add a 2D map to the app

1. Open `Main.storyboard`. Use the **Object** library to add a **Custom View** to your main view. Pin it to the top, bottom, and left edges of your main view. Pin it to 20 pixels from the button you added. In the **Identity** inspector, change the custom view’s class from `NSView` to `AGSMapView`. If `AGSMapView` does not appear in the dropdown, type `AGSMapView`.

1. Choose **View** > **Assistant Editor** > **Show Assistant Editor**. In the Assistant Editor, open ViewController.swift if it does not open by default. Right-click and drag your Map View to the `ViewController` Swift code in order to insert an outlet in the `ViewController` class. Name the outlet `mapView`. That should give you a like like this in `ViewController.swift`:

    ```
    @IBOutlet weak var mapView: AGSMapView!
    ```

1. In `ViewController.swift`, before the class declaration, import ArcGIS:

    ```
    import ArcGIS
    ```

1. In `viewDidLoad()`, give your map view a new map that contains a basemap:

    ```
    mapView.map = AGSMap(basemap: AGSBasemap.nationalGeographicBasemap())
    ```

1. Open Info.plist as source code (i.e. plain text editor). You will see a series of key/string pairs. At the end of that series, add the following key/dict pair:

    ```
    <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
        <dict>
            <key>arcgisonline.com</key>
            <dict>
                <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
                <true/>
                <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
                <true/>
            </dict>
            <key>arcgis.com</key>
            <dict>
                <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
                <true/>  
                <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>  
                <true/>  
            </dict>  
        </dict>  
    </dict>
    ```

1. Run your app. Verify that a map fills the window and that the button appears on the right:

    ![Map and button](02-map-and-button.png)
    
## Add a 3D scene to the app, and use a toggle button to switch between 2D and 3D

The Quartz release brings 3D visualization to ArcGIS Runtime. Everyone loves 3D! To conclude this exercise, you will add a 3D scene to the app, as well as a button that lets the user toggle between seeing the 2D map and seeing the 3D scene.

1. Open `Main.storyboard`. Use the **Object** library to add another Custom View to your main view. Make sure it’s a child of the main view, not the map view. Give it the same dimensions and constraints as your map view. Set its class to `AGSSceneView`. In the Attributes inspector, check the **Hidden** box.

1. In the Assistant Editor, open `ViewController.swift`. Right-click and drag to create outlets for the scene view and the button:

    ```
    @IBOutlet weak var sceneView: AGSSceneView!
    @IBOutlet weak var button_toggle2d3d: NSButton!
    ```

1. Right-click and drag the button to create another connection, but this time, change the connection from **Outlet** to **Action**. Give it a name, e.g. `button_toggle2d3d_onAction`. You can change its type to `NSButton` if desired. Click Connect, and a new method is created:

    ```
    @IBAction func button_toggle2d3d_onAction(sender: NSButton) {
    }
    ```

1. Close the Assistant Editor. In your `ViewController` class, instantiate a constant for the URL of an elevation service, as well as a variable to keep track of whether the app is currently displaying 3D or not:

    ```
    let ELEVATION_IMAGE_SERVICE = "http://elevation3d.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/WorldElevation3D/Terrain3D/ImageServer"

    private var threeD = false
    ```

1. In the 2D/3D toggle button action method, change the value of the `threeD` field, and change the button's image. Also toggle the visibility of the map view and scene view:

    ```
    @IBAction func button_toggle2d3d_onAction(sender: NSButton) {
        threeD = !threeD
        button_toggle2d3d.image = NSImage(named: threeD ? "two_d" : "three_d")

        mapView.hidden = threeD
        sceneView.hidden = !threeD
    }
    ```

1. In `viewDidLoad()`, set up the 3D scene’s basemap and elevation. Give the scene view a scene with a basemap, and give the scene an elevation surface:

    ```
    sceneView.scene = AGSScene(basemapType: AGSBasemapType.Imagery)
    let surface = AGSSurface()
    surface.elevationSources.append(AGSArcGISTiledElevationSource(URL: NSURL(string: ELEVATION_IMAGE_SERVICE)!));
    sceneView.scene!.baseSurface = surface;
    ```
    
1. Run your app. Verify that clicking the button changes its image and also toggles between 2D and 3D:
    
    ![Toggle to 3D](03-toggle-to-3d.jpg)
    
## How did it go?

If you have trouble, **refer to the solution code**, which is linked near the beginning of this exercise. You can also **submit an issue** in this repo to ask a question or report a problem. If you are participating live with Esri presenters, feel free to **ask a question** of the presenters.

If you completed the exercise, congratulations! You learned how to add a 2D map and a 3D scene to an app, using ArcGIS Runtime.

Ready for more? Choose from the following:

- [**Exercise 2: Add Zoom In and Zoom Out Buttons**](Exercise 2 Zoom Buttons.md)
- **Bonus**: the map and scene we added operate independently. When you pan the map, the scene does not move, and when you pan the scene, the map does not move. Can you figure out how to link the viewpoints of the map and the scene so that when you pan one, the other automatically pans? 2D and 3D use different mechanisms for panning and zooming, so watch out! Send us a pull request if you figure it out.
