# Exercise 3: Add Operational Layers (iOS/Swift)

This exercise walks you through the following:
- Add a layer from a mobile map package to the 2D map
- Add a scene layer to the 3D scene

Prerequisites:
- Complete [Exercise 2](Exercise%202%20Zoom%20Buttons.md), or get the Exercise 2 code solution compiling and running properly in Xcode.

If you need some help, you can refer to [the solution to this exercise](../../../solutions/iOS/Swift/Ex3_OperationalLayers), available in this repository.

## Add a layer from a mobile map package to the 2D map

ArcGIS Runtime provides a variety of ways to add **operational layers** to the map and scene--feature services, dynamic map services, offline geodatabases, and mobile map packages, for example. In this exercise, you will use the newest of these: a mobile map package.

1. Download the [D.C. Crime Data mobile map package (`DC_Crime_Data.mmpk`)](../../../data/DC_Crime_Data.mmpk) that we have prepared for you. In Xcode, add `DC_Crime`Data.mmpk` to your project (select your project in the Navigator and choose **File** > **Add Files to <project name>**).

1. In `ViewController.swift`, declare a constant for the MMPK path. Use `Bundle.main.path` to construct the path:

    ```
    fileprivate let MMPK_PATH = URL(
        string: Bundle.main.path(forResource: "DC_Crime_Data", ofType:"mmpk")!)
    ```

1. At the end of `viewDidLoad()`, instantiate an `AGSMobileMapPackage` with the mobile map package constant. Then load the mobile map package with a completion to run when the mobile map package is done loading:

    ```
    let mmpk = AGSMobileMapPackage(fileURL: MMPK_PATH!)
    mmpk.load {(error) in
        
    }
    ```
    
1. Inside the `load` completion code, get the `MobileMapPackage`'s maps. A mobile map package can contain multiple maps. `DC_Crime_Data.mmpk` only has one map, but it's a good idea to make sure there's at least one. If so, get the first map (index 0), and use it to set the map viewâ€™s map. (That's the easy way to add the mobile map package's layers; we will need to use a different way later in this exercise to add the layers to a 3D scene.) The map in this mobile map package has no basemap, so it's a good idea to set the basemap again. Here's the code that goes inside the event handler method:

    ```
    if 0 < mmpk.maps.count {
        self.mapView.map = mmpk.maps[0]
    }
    self.mapView.map!.basemap = AGSBasemap.topographicVector()
    ```
    
1. Run your app. Verify that the map zooms to Washington, D.C., and that a layer of crime incidents appears on top of the basemap. The incidents appear as red triangles, which is the symbology specified in the mobile map package:

## Add a scene layer to the 3D scene

Web scene layers are cached web layers that are optimized for displaying a large amount of 2D and 3D features. Scene layers can be viewed in a variety of ArcGIS clients, including ArcGIS Runtime. Here you will add a scene layer to your 3D scene.

1. Declare a constant value to specify the URL of a scene service. You can use a `SceneServer` URL or an ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS item URL that represents a scene service. The following URL shows plain gray buildings in Washington, D.C.:

    ```
    fileprivate let SCENE_SERVICE_URL = URL(string:
        "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=606596bae9e44394b42621e099ba392a")
    ```

    The following URL shows photo-realistic buildings in Philadelphia:

    ```
    fileprivate let SCENE_SERVICE_URL = URL(string:
        "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a7419641a50e412c980cf242c29aa3c0")
    ```
1. At the end of `viewDidLoad()`, instantiate an `AGSArcGISSceneLayer` with the scene service URL constant. Then load the scene layer with a completion to run when the layer is done loading. (This should seem familiar.)

    ```
    let sceneLayer = AGSArcGISSceneLayer(url: SCENE_SERVICE_URL!)
    sceneLayer.load{(error) in

    }
    ```

1. Inside the `loadWithCompletion` completion code, set the scene view's viewpoint to the full extent of the scene layer:

    ```
    self.sceneView.setViewpoint(AGSViewpoint(targetExtent: sceneLayer.fullExtent!))
    ```

1. Run your app. Verify that when you switch to 3D, the scene displays the 3D features from the scene layer:

    ![Scene layer on a 3D scene](06-scene-layer.jpg)
    
1. Remember in [Exercise 2](Exercise%202%20Zoom%20Buttons.md#zoom-in-and-out-on-the-map-and-the-scene) when you manipulated a camera to zoom in and out? Here we will also use a camera, but this time we will rotate the camera to provide an oblique view of the scene. We will focus the rotation on the current viewpoint's target point. The `AGSCamera.rotateAroundTargetPoint` method lets us specify a change in heading, pitch, and roll; let's change the heading by 45 degrees and the pitch by 65 degrees. After `rotateAroundTargetPoint`, we will give the rotated camera to the scene view. Here is the code to insert immediately after the previous step (still inside the `if` block):

    ```
    let viewpoint = self.sceneView.currentViewpoint(with: AGSViewpointType.centerAndScale)
    let targetPoint = viewpoint?.targetGeometry
    let camera = self.sceneView.currentViewpointCamera().rotateAroundTargetPoint(targetPoint as! AGSPoint, deltaHeading: 45.0, deltaPitch: 65.0, deltaRoll: 0.0)
    self.sceneView.setViewpointCamera(camera)
    ```

1. Run your app. Verify that when you switch to 3D, the 3D features display and the view is rotated and pitched:

## How did it go?

If you have trouble, **refer to the solution code**, which is linked near the beginning of this exercise. You can also **submit an issue** in this repo to ask a question or report a problem. If you are participating live with Esri presenters, feel free to **ask a question** of the presenters.

If you completed the exercise, congratulations! You learned how to add a local feature layer from a mobile map package to a 2D map and a scene layer to a 3D scene.

Ready for more? Choose from the following:

- [**Exercise 4: Buffer a Point and Query Features**](Exercise%204%20Buffer%20and%20Query.md)
- **Bonus**: we used a mobile map package, but you can also add **feature services** to your map and scene. Go to [ArcGIS Online](http://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html), find a feature service URL (hint: a feature service URL has the term `FeatureServer` at or near the end of the URL), and use the [`AGSFeatureLayer`](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/api-reference/interface_a_g_s_feature_layer.html) and [`AGSServiceFeatureTable`](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/api-reference/interface_a_g_s_service_feature_table.html) classes to add the feature service to your map and/or globe. You can refer to a [code sample](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-ios/tree/v100.1.0/arcgis-ios-sdk-samples/Features/Feature%20layer%20(feature%20service)) if you need it.
